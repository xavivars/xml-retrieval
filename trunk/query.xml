<description> Retrieve information about association rule mining in
medical databases </description>
<narrative> We have a medical data mining project and I want to find
out how other people have applied association rule mining in this
area. A relevant snippet will discuss the application of association
rule mining to a medical database. Discussion of association rule
mining outside medical databases is not relevant. Discussion of
medical databases without association rule mining is also not
relevant. </narrative>
